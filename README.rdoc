== Zendesk Help Form in Rails

This Rails application is a simple form that creates a new ticket with a new requester. On form submission success, it will create a ticket in the Zendesk backend.

When that user logs into their account, they will be able to view all the tickets they've submitted.

To get this to run locally make sure you set environment variables for ZD_URL, ZD_USER, ZD_PASS.
